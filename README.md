# [Conversation Augmentation: Chat Mediator Bot](https://github.com/joelpurra/conversation-augmentation-chat-mediator-bot)

Reduce anger and improve person-to-person conversations with the help of a mediating chatbot. This particular bot blocks messages which have a low [sentiment score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) from being sent to the other chat participant.

## Have a civilized conversation

- Open a private window with your bot
- You can `start session demo`
- Let someone else `join session demo`
- Chat with reduced aggressiveness!
  - Most messages are let through.
  - Messages with "aggressive" words, such as curse words are blocked.



## Augmentation by encouraging more positive messages

- In a person-to-person conversation, each message is inspected by the mediating chatbot before being passed on.
- Each message is given a [sentiment score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) using a [word-by-word analysis](https://github.com/thisandagain/sentiment).
- A negative score indicates that the message is aggressive.
- Very aggressive messages are blocked by the mediator, and never seen by the other chat participant.
- The chat user is instead encouraged to write a nicer message, which would then be delivered.
- This way the most blatant aggressiveness can be avoided, and hopefully slowing down or stopping a downward agressiveness spiral.



## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies.
npm install

# Run and open the chatbot server and UI/editor.
npm run --silent start
open http://127.0.0.1:1880/

# Now use the UI to configure:
#  - your slack bot token
#  - your mongodb connection

# Chat with your bot through slack!
```



## Development

All bot development was made using the visual editor in [node-red](https://nodered.org/) using nodes from the [node-red-contrib-chatbot](https://github.com/guidone/node-red-contrib-chatbot) plugin/addon. It's all running locally, using the commands above, and it's *really, really, really* easy to improve the bot without programming. Here's an example of "visual code" in the main flow:
